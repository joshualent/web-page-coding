## Page Structure

<App></App><br/>

:::note VSCode Shortcut
You can quickly create this html document structure by typing <kbd>!</kbd> in an empty `.html` file in VSCode. You will get a pop-up labelled "emmet abbreviation" which you can accept by clicking on it or pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
:::

Let's look at the elements in this starter template:
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top tells browsers this is an HTML5 document
- The `<html>` element is the root element that wraps all content
- The `<head>` section contains metadata about the document:
    - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` specifies the character encoding
    - `<meta name="viewport">` helps with mobile responsive display
    - `<title>` sets the page title shown in browser tabs
- The `<body>` element is where visible page content will go

## Headings and Text
The main content of web pages consists of headings, paragraphs, and other text elements. HTML provides heading elements from `<h1>` (most important) through `<h6>` (least important).

{/* :::note Tags vs. Elements
In HTML, a "tag" refers to the markup used to create an element. For example, `<h1>` is the opening tag for a level 1 heading element, and `</h1>` is the closing tag. An "element" refers to the complete structure including the opening tag, content, and closing tag (e.g., `<h1>This is a heading</h1>`). Some tags are self-closing and do not require a closing tag, such as `<br>` for line breaks.
::: */}

Paragraphs are created with the `<p>` tag.

    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Main Heading</h1>
        <h2>Subheading</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text. HTML will automatically wrap text within paragraph tags.</p>
        <h3>Smaller Heading</h3>
        <p>Another paragraph showing different heading levels.</p>
    </body>
</html>`
